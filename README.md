# Spaceworms
Simple 8x8 screen game designed for Arduino Uno. **Check the [Wiki for Documentation](https://github.com/taralesca/Spaceworms/wiki/Documentation)**


## Required physical parts

* 1088AS LED Matrix (or other, as long as connected with MAX7219)
* MAX7219 Driver
* 16x2 LED Display
* Potentiometer / Joystick or any type of analog input *(minor changes may be necessary)*.
* Pushbutton
* 10 mF capacitor
* 10k & 1k Ohm resistors
* Countless wires & endless patience

## Game Idea

* Spaceworms are 2x1 critters which live inside *(or immediately outside)* the LED Matrix.
* Your purpose is to defend Earth *(or the bottom line of the matrix)* from them for as long as possible.
* The spaceship has infinite ammo, but you will eventually fail and the game will end as the worms become faster and faster each space-day *(5 Earthly seconds)*. Do not worry, though, you only care about getting a Highscore.

### Gameplay

* Shoot your laser gun by pressing the button.
* Move using the potentiometer.
* ... repeat
